# Monster Rolodex

Monster Rolodex is a React.js project that showcases a virtual rolodex of monsters. It leverages various React concepts such as filtering, mapping, component state management, and fetching data from an external API. The project is published on GitHub Pages, allowing users to easily access and interact with the Monster Rolodex.

## Features

- **Filtering:** Users can search for specific monsters by typing in the search box. The Monster Rolodex dynamically filters the displayed monsters based on the user's search query.

- **Mapping:** The project demonstrates the use of the `map` function in React to iterate over the monster data and generate individual monster cards.

- **Component State:** React component state is used to manage the search query and the rendering of the filtered monsters. The state is updated dynamically as the user interacts with the search box.

- **API Fetching:** The project fetches monster data from an external API. This demonstrates the usage of the `fetch` function or other similar methods to retrieve data and incorporate it into the React application.

## Technologies Used

- React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- HTML: Markup language for structuring the web page.
- CSS: Stylesheet language for enhancing the appearance of the web page.
